This code was written for the first of two projets in CS 124, Computation Genetics.

The purpose of the project was to familiarize us with running automated correlation
tests between diffent SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in a set of patients.

In the first part of the project, we had to create a set of 1000 patients, 100 of which
were our cases, and 900 of which were the controls. There was 1 SNP at a known location
that appeared in 95% of the cases but only 20% of the controls. Every other SNP appeared
with probability 50%. Our job was to see if any of the random SNPs were correlated with
the causal SNP.

The second part of the project was to find a minimum spanning set of SNPs. A minimum spanning
set takes of advantage of correlated SNPs. Our goal would be to find a subset of the 200 total
SNPs of the smallest possible size such that every SNP is in the subset, or is correlated to 
an SNP in the subset.
In order to get a feel for how relatedness of individuals plays a part in SNP correlation, we
repeated this process with patients that were 0%, 20%, and 50% related. By adjusting the constants
on lines 10 and 11, you can change the relatedness of the patients. The default value is 0%, which
doesn't lead to many correlations and makes the minimum spanning set very large. If you increase
the constants, you will see the size of the minimum spanning sets begin to decrease.
