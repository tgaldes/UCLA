This was the third project for Operating Systems Principles. The goal of this project was to fill in skeleton code for a working file system.

The project was written on an Ubuntu VM that was distributed to the class. The VM was configured to run QEMU.

To test the file system on a QEMU capable system, use the following commands

./run-qemu

press enter

cd test

The file system that runs the code my partner and I wrote is mounted when you switch into the test directory. Inside the test directory you can use a variety of commands to modify the files and observe the behavior of the file system. Alternatively, run

./lab3-tester.pl

to see the test script distributed by the TAs run.

The file system works with the exception of some writes to files.
